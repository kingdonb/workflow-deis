# Testing Deis

Each Deis component is one among an ecosystem of such components - many of which integrate with one another - which makes testing each component thoroughly a matter of paramount importance.

Each Deis component includes its own suite of style checks, [unit tests][], and black-box type [functional tests][].

[Integration tests][] verify the behavior of the Deis components together as a system and are provided separately by the [teamhephy/workflow-e2e][workflow-e2e] project.

GitHub pull requests for all Deis components are tested automatically by the [Travis CI][travis] [continuous integration][] system. Contributors should run the same tests locally before proposing any changes to the Deis codebase.

## Set Up the Environment

Successfully executing the unit and functional tests for any Deis component requires that the [Development Environment][dev-environment] is set up first.

## Run the Tests

The style checks, unit tests, and functional tests for each component can all be executed via make targets:

To execute style checks:

```
$ make test-style
```

To execute unit tests:

```
$ make test-unit
```

To execute functional tests:

```
$ make test-functional
```

To execute style checks, unit tests, and functional tests all in one shot:

```
$ make test
```

To execute integration tests, refer to [teamhephy/workflow-e2e][workflow-e2e] documentation.
